# card-collection-tracker

A personal web app for tracking your Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG collection.  
Built with **React + TypeScript + Vite**, this project allows you to search cards from the [YGOPRODeck API](https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/), add them to your collection, and persist them locally.

> ⚡ MVP Focus: Local-only app (no authentication or cloud sync yet).  
> Phase 1 goal — Search → Add → View → Remove cards.
